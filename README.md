# week-1-code-refactor-challenge

The task:
 
**Refactoring** existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.

The steps I took to complete the task:

1. I researched semantic html and drafted out a structured page using semantic elements.

2. I then structured the page so that it would have a semantic elements such as a header, nav, a section for the top hero image section and have a main section underneath. 

3. I changed the main sections from divs to articles as they were describing products offered by the company and entered information about the images so that it is more accessible for screen readers etc.

4. I saw that the side bar was not the main focus so I changed this from a div to an aside element and put the three paragraphs into three sections.

5. I changed the div element for the footer to a semantic footer element.

6. Lastly I checked the acceptance criteria to make sure the website now followed this critera.
